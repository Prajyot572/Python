1) A string represents a sequence of characters.
2) It is an immutable data type in most of the programming language including Java and Python, meaning that once you have created a string, you cannot change it.
3) Python programming does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
4) Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes or even triple quotes.
5) In this example, we will demonstrate different ways to create a Python String.
	a) We will create a string using single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), and triple double quotes (""" """), the triple double quotes can be used to declare
           multiline string in Python.
